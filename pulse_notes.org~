pulse delayer (notes for that? 24/9 grey notebook:

X pulses can be delayed every second, XandY graph determines delay for say 2000 pulses per second (memory=each pulse has a time and a delay) 2khz signal…

modes for resolution

delay and decay

how delay works - swop rec/play…??? delay line is simpler… samples go
into delay line which wraps… // list of pulses…

ffedback- wet/dry out

pulse stretch
